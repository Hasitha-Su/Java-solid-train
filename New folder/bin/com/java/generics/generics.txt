Generics

1.why generics
2.generics methods
3.generics classes
4.bounded type parameters
5.compile time type checking
    Generics stop run time errors at compile time
    ex: you will not add string to a int array list by mistake. since it will throw the error on compilation


collections can have any type of a object and that presents us with a type safety problem
most of the time we want our list to have only one type of objects. generics solves this problem
